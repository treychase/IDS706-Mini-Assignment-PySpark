    "\n",
    "**Key Optimizations Implemented:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Early Filtering (Predicate Pushdown)**\n",
    "   - Applied filters immediately after loading data\n",
    "   - Spark pushes these predicates down to the Parquet file reader\n",
    "   - Reduces data read from disk by skipping irrelevant row groups\n",
    "   - Observed in execution plan: `PushedFilters` section\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Columnar Storage (Parquet)**\n",
    "   - Used Parquet format which stores data by column\n",
    "   - Only reads required columns (column pruning)\n",
    "   - Compression reduces I/O\n",
    "   - Observed in plan: `ReadSchema` shows only needed columns\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Broadcast Join**\n",
    "   - Used broadcast for joining small location summary with large dataset\n",
    "   - Avoids expensive shuffle operation\n",
    "   - Copies small table to all executors\n",
    "   - Observed in plan: `BroadcastHashJoin` instead of `SortMergeJoin`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Partitioning Strategy**\n",
    "   - Output data partitioned by is_weekend and time_of_day\n",
    "   - Future queries on these columns will be much faster\n",
    "   - Partition pruning eliminates unnecessary file reads\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Adaptive Query Execution (AQE)**\n",
    "   - Enabled AQE to dynamically optimize at runtime\n",
